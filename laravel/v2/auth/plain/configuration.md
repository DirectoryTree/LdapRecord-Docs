# Plain Auth Configuration

## Introduction

To configure a plain LDAP authentication provider, navigate to the `providers` array
inside of your `config/auth.php` file, and paste the following `users` provider:

> You will have to remove the default included `users` provider.

```php
// config/auth.php

'providers' => [
    // ...

    'users' => [
        'driver' => 'ldap',
        'model' => LdapRecord\Models\ActiveDirectory\User::class,
        'rules' => [],
    ],
],
```

> **Important**: If your application requires more than one LDAP connection, you
> must create a new provider for each connection.
> <br/><br/>
> This new provider must have its own unique `model` class which must use your
> [alternate configured connection](/docs/core/v2/models#connections) name
> using the `$connection` property.

In the scenario of having multiple LDAP connections, it may be helpful to namespace the LDAP models
you create with the desired connection. For example:

```text
App\Ldap\DomainAlpha\User
```

This will allow you to segregate scopes, rules and other classes to their relating connection.

## Driver

The `driver` option must be `ldap` as this is what indicates to Laravel the proper authentication driver to use.

## Model

The `model` option must be the class name of your [LdapRecord model](/docs/core/v2/models). This model will be used
for fetching users from your directory.

## Rules

The `rules` option must be an array of [authentication rule](#rules) class names.

### Overview

LDAP authentication rules give you the ability to allow or deny users from signing into your
application using a condition you would like to apply. These rules are executed **after**
a user successfully passes LDAP authentication against your configured server.

Think of them as a final authorization gate before they are allowed in.

> Authentication rules are never executed if a user fails LDAP authentication.

### Creating Rules

Let's create an LDAP rule that only allows members of our domain `Administrators` group.

To create an authentication rule, call the `make:ldap-rule` command:

```bash
php artisan make:ldap-rule OnlyAdministrators
```

A rule will then be created in your applications `app/Ldap/Rules` directory:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Ldap\Rules;

use LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\Rule;

class OnlyAdministrators extends Rule
{
    /**
     * Check if the rule passes validation.
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    public function isValid()
    {
        //
    }
}
```

In the authentication rule, a `$user` property will be made available to us.

Now, we will update the `isValid` method to check the LDAP users `groups` relationship to see if they are a member:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Ldap\Rules;

use LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\Rule;
use LdapRecord\Models\ActiveDirectory\Group;

class OnlyAdministrators extends Rule
{
    public function isValid()
    {
        $administrators = Group::find('cn=Administrators,dc=local,dc=com');

        return $this->user->groups()->recursive()->exists($administrators);
    }
}
```

> We call the `recursive` method on the relationship to make sure that we load groups of
> groups in case the user is not an immediate member of the `Administrators` group.

Once we have our rule defined, we will add it into our authentication provider in the `config/auth.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...

    'ldap' => [
        'driver' => 'ldap',
        'model' => LdapRecord\Models\ActiveDirectory\User::class,
        'rules' => [
            App\Ldap\Rules\OnlyAdministrators::class,
        ],
    ],
],
```

Now when you attempt to login to your application with a LDAP user that successfully passes
LDAP authentication, they will need to be a member of the `Administrators` group.

If you are caching your configuration, make sure you re-run `config:cache` to re-cache your modifications.
