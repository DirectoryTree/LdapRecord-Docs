[Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits#laravel-breeze) provides basic authentication scaffolding out-of-the-box.

This guide will show you how to integrate LdapRecord-Laravel using this scaffolding.

## Debugging

inside your `config/ldap.php` file, ensure you have `logging` enabled during the setup of authentication.
Doing this will help you immensely in debugging connectivity and authentication issues.

If you encounter issues along the way, be sure to open your `storage/logs` directory after you
attempt signing in to your application and see what issues may be occurring.

In addition, you may also run the below artisan command to test connectivity to your LDAP server:

```bash
php artisan ldap:test
```

## Login Request

For this example application, we will authenticate our LDAP users with their email address using the LDAP attribute `mail`.

For LdapRecord to properly locate the user in your directory during sign in,
we will override the `authenticate` method in the `LoginRequest`, and
pass in an array with the `mail` key (which is the attribute we are
wanting to retrieve our LDAP users by) and the users `password`:

```php
// app/Http/Requests/Auth/LoginRequest.php

/**
 * Attempt to authenticate the request's credentials.
 *
 * @return void
 *
 * @throws \Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException
 */
public function authenticate()
{
    $this->ensureIsNotRateLimited();

    $credentials = [
        'mail' => $this->email,
        'password' => $this->password,
    ];

    if (! Auth::attempt($credentials, $this->filled('remember'))) {
        RateLimiter::hit($this->throttleKey());

        throw ValidationException::withMessages([
            'email' => __('auth.failed'),
        ]);
    }

    RateLimiter::clear($this->throttleKey());
}
```

That's it! You are now ready to authenticate LDAP users into your application.

## Using Usernames

To authenticate your users by their username we must adjust some scaffolded code generated by Laravel Breeze.

In the following example, we will authenticate users by their `sAMAccountName`.

### Sync Attributes

We will first need to adjust our `sync_attributes` array, located inside our `config/auth.php` file.

The only thing we need to change is the `email` key:

**From**:

```php
// config/auth.php

'sync_attributes' => [
    // ...
    'email' => 'mail',
],
```

**To**:

```php
// config/auth.php

'sync_attributes' => [
    // ...
    'username' => 'samaccountname',
],
```

### User Migration

Now we have adjusted our synchronized attributes, we need to adjust the `users` database table migration.

Similarly, as above, we only need to change the `email` column to `username`:

**From**:

```php
Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    // ...
    $table->string('email')->unique();
    // ...
});
```

**To**:

```php
Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    // ...
    $table->string('username')->unique();
    // ...
});
```

### Login Form

We're almost there. We will now need to update the input HTML field inside the scaffolded `login.blade.php` view:

**From**:

```html
<!-- resources/views/auth/login.blade.php -->

<!-- Email Address -->
<div>
  <x-label for="email" :value="__('Email')" />

  <x-input
    id="email"
    class="block w-full mt-1"
    type="email"
    name="email"
    :value="old('email')"
    required
    autofocus
  />
</div>
```

**To**:

```html
<!-- resources/views/auth/login.blade.php -->

<!-- Username -->
<div>
  <x-label for="username" :value="__('Username')" />

  <x-input
    id="username"
    class="block w-full mt-1"
    type="text"
    name="username"
    :value="old('username')"
    required
    autofocus
  />
</div>
```

### Login Request

This last step requires adjusting the `rules()` and `authenticate()` methods inside the scaffolded `LoginRequest.php` class:

**From**:

```php
// app/Http/Requests/Auth/LoginRequest.php

public function rules()
{
    return [
        'email' => 'required|string|email',
        'password' => 'required|string',
    ];
}

public function authenticate()
{
    $this->ensureIsNotRateLimited();

    if (! Auth::attempt($request->only('email', 'password'), $this->filled('remember'))) {
        RateLimiter::hit($this->throttleKey());

        throw ValidationException::withMessages([
            'email' => __('auth.failed'),
        ]);
    }

    RateLimiter::clear($this->throttleKey());
}
```

**To**:

```php
// app/Http/Requests/Auth/LoginRequest.php

public function rules()
{
    return [
        'username' => 'required|string',
        'password' => 'required|string',
    ];
}

public function authenticate()
{
    $this->ensureIsNotRateLimited();

    $credentials = [
        'samaccountname' => $this->username,
        'password' => $this->password,
    ];

    if (! Auth::attempt($credentials, $this->filled('remember'))) {
        RateLimiter::hit($this->throttleKey());

        throw ValidationException::withMessages([
            'email' => __('auth.failed'),
        ]);
    }

    RateLimiter::clear($this->throttleKey());
}
```

You are now ready to log in LDAP users by their username!

## Fallback Authentication

Database fallback allows the authentication of local database users if:

- LDAP connectivity is not present.
- **Or**; An LDAP user cannot be found.

For example, given the following `users` database table:

| id  | name         | email               | password | guid   | domain |
| --- | ------------ | ------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1   | Steve Bauman | sbauman@outlook.com | ...      | `null` | `null` |

If a user attempts to log in with the above email address and this user does
not exist inside your LDAP directory, then standard Eloquent authentication
will be performed instead.

This feature is ideal for environments where:

- LDAP server connectivity may be intermittent.
- **Or**; You have regular users registering normally in your application.

To enable this feature, you must define a `fallback` array inside the `$credentials`
you pass to the `Auth::attempt()` method inside your `LoginRequest`:

```php
// app/Http/Requests/Auth/LoginRequest.php

public function authenticate()
{
    $this->ensureIsNotRateLimited();

    $credentials = [
        'mail' => $this->email,
        'password' => $this->password,
        'fallback' => [
            'email' => $this->email,
            'password' => $this->password,
        ],
    ];

    if (! Auth::attempt($credentials, $this->filled('remember'))) {
        RateLimiter::hit($this->throttleKey());

        throw ValidationException::withMessages([
            'email' => __('auth.failed'),
        ]);
    }

    RateLimiter::clear($this->throttleKey());
}
```

> If you would like your LDAP users to be able to sign in to your application
> when LDAP connectivity fails or is not present, you must enable the
> [sync passwords](#database-password-sync) option, so your LDAP
> users can sign in using their last used password.
> <br/><br/>
> If an LDAP users password has not been synchronized, they will not be able to sign in.

## Eloquent Model Binding

Model binding allows you to access the currently authenticated user's LdapRecord model
from their Eloquent model. This grants you access to their LDAP model whenever you need it.

To begin, insert the `LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\HasLdapUser` trait onto your `User` eloquent model:

```php
// app/Models/User.php

// ...

use LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\HasLdapUser;
use LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\LdapAuthenticatable;
use LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\AuthenticatesWithLdap;

class User extends Authenticatable implements LdapAuthenticatable
{
    use HasFactory, Notifiable, AuthenticatesWithLdap, HasLdapUser;

    // ...
}
```

Now, after an LDAP user logs into your application, their LdapRecord model will be
available on their Eloquent model via the `ldap` property:

> If their LDAP model cannot be located, the returned will be `null`.

```php
// Instance of App\Models\User:
$user = Auth::user();

// Instance of LdapRecord\Models\Model:
$user->ldap;

// Get LDAP user attributes:
echo $user->ldap->getFirstAttribute('cn');

// Get LDAP user relationships:
$groups = $user->ldap->groups()->get();
```

> This property uses deferred loading -- which means that the users LDAP model only
> gets requested from your server when you attempt to access it. This prevents
> loading the model unnecessarily when it is not needed in your application.

## Displaying LDAP Error Messages

When a user fails LDAP authentication due to their password / account expiring, account
lockout, or their password requiring to be changed, specific error codes will be sent
back from your server. LdapRecord can interpret these for you and display
helpful error messages to users upon failing authentication.

![LDAP Error Message](/doc-images/ldap-error-message.png "Screenshot of an LDAP error message being displayed")

To enable this feature, you will have to:

1. Navigate to the scaffolded `AuthenticatedSessionController.php`
2. Insert the `ListensForLdapBindFailure` trait
3. Call the `listenForLdapBindFailure()` method in the constructor:

```php
// app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php

use LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\ListensForLdapBindFailure;

class AuthenticatedSessionController extends Controller
{
    use ListensForLdapBindFailure;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->listenForLdapBindFailure();
    }

    // ...
}
```

### Changing The Input Field

By default, LdapRecord-Laravel will attach the LDAP error to the `email` input field.
If you're using a different input field, you can customize it by adding a `username` property to the `AuthenticatedSessionController`:

```php
use LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\ListensForLdapBindFailure;

class AuthenticatedSessionController extends Controller
{
    use ListensForLdapBindFailure;

    protected $username = 'username';

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->listenForLdapBindFailure();
    }

    // ...
}
```

### Changing the Error Messages

If you need to modify the translations of these error messages, create a new translation
file named `errors.php` in your `resources` directory at the following path:

> The `vendor` directory (and each subdirectory) will have to be created manually.

#### Laravel >= 9

```
lang/
└── vendor/
    └── ldap/
        └── en/
            └── errors.php
```

#### Laravel <= 8

```
resources/
└── lang/
    └── vendor/
        └── ldap/
            └── en/
                └── errors.php
```

Then, paste in the following translations in the file and modify where necessary:

```php
<?php

return [
    'user_not_found' => 'User not found.',
    'user_not_permitted_at_this_time' => 'Not permitted to logon at this time.',
    'user_not_permitted_to_login' => 'Not permitted to logon at this workstation.',
    'password_expired' => 'Your password has expired.',
    'account_disabled' => 'Your account is disabled.',
    'account_expired' => 'Your account has expired.',
    'user_must_reset_password' => 'You must reset your password before logging in.',
    'user_account_locked' => 'Your account is locked.',
];
```

### Altering the Response

By default, when an LDAP bind failure occurs, a `ValidationException` will be thrown which will
redirect users to your login page and display the error. If you would like to modify this
behaviour, you will need to override the method `handleLdapBindError`.

This method will include the error `$message` as the first parameter and the error `$code` as the second.
This is useful for checking for specific Active Directory response codes and returning a response:

```php
use Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException;
use LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\ListensForLdapBindFailure;

class AuthenticatedSessionController extends Controller
{
    use ListensForLdapBindFailure;

    protected function handleLdapBindError($message, $code = null)
    {
        if ($code == '773') {
            // The users password has expired. Redirect them.
            abort(redirect('/password-reset'));
        }

        throw ValidationException::withMessages([
            'email' => "Whoops! LDAP server cannot be reached.",
        ]);
    }

    // ...
}
```

> Refer to the [Password Policy Errors](/docs/core/v3/active-directory/users#password-policy-errors)
> documentation to see what each code means.
