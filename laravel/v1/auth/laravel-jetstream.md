# Laravel Jetstream

## Introduction

Laravel Jetstream utilizes [Laravel Fortify](https://github.com/laravel/fortify) for authentication under the hood.
We will customize various aspects of it to allow our LDAP users to sign in successfully.

## Fortify Setup

### Authentication Callback

For this example application, we will authenticate our LDAP users
with their email address using the LDAP attribute `mail`.

For LdapRecord to properly locate the user in your directory during sign in, we will
override Fortify's authentication callback using the `Fortify::authenticateUsing()`
method in our `AuthServiceProvider.php` file:

```php
// app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php

// ...
use Laravel\Fortify\Fortify;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    // ...

    public function boot()
    {
        $this->registerPolicies();

        Fortify::authenticateUsing(function ($request) {
            $validated = Auth::validate([
                'mail' => $request->email,
                'password' => $request->password
            ]);

            return $validated ? Auth::getLastAttempted() : null;
        });
    }
}
```

As you can see above, we set the `mail` key which is passed to the LdapRecord authentication provider.

A search query will be executed on your directory for a user that contains the `mail` attribute equal
to the entered `email` that the user has submitted on your login form. The `password`
key will not be used in the search.

If a user cannot be located in your directory, or they fail authentication, they will be redirected to the
login page normally with the "_Invalid credentials_" error message.

> You may also add extra key => value pairs in the `credentials` array to further scope the
> LDAP query. The `password` key is automatically ignored by LdapRecord.

### Feature Configuration

Since we are synchronizing data from our LDAP server, we must disable the following
features by commenting them out inside of the `config/fortify.php` file:

```php
// config/fortify.php

// Before:
'features' => [
    Features::registration(),
    Features::resetPasswords(),
    // Features::emailVerification(),
    Features::updateProfileInformation(),
    Features::updatePasswords(),
    // Features::twoFactorAuthentication(),
],

// After:
'features' => [
    // Features::registration(),
    // Features::resetPasswords(),
    // Features::emailVerification(),
    // Features::updateProfileInformation(),
    // Features::updatePasswords(),
    // Features::twoFactorAuthentication(),
],
```

> **Important**: You may keep `Features::registration()` enabled if you would like
> to continue accepting local application user registration. Keep in mind, if you
> continue to allow registration, you will need to either use multiple Laravel
> authentication guards, or setup the [login fallback](#fallback-auth) feature.

## Using Usernames

To authenticate your users by their username we must adjust some scaffolded code generated by Laravel Jetstream.

In the following example, we will authenticate users by their `sAMAccountName`.

### Fortify Setup

#### Authentication Callback

With our Fortiy configuration updated, we will jump into our `AuthServiceProvider.php` file
and setup our authentication callback using the `Fortify::authenticateUsing()` method:

```php
// app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php

// ...
use Laravel\Fortify\Fortify;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    // ...

    public function boot()
    {
        $this->registerPolicies();

        Fortify::authenticateUsing(function ($request) {
            $validated = Auth::validate([
                'samaccountname' => $request->username,
                'password' => $request->password
            ]);

            return $validated ? Auth::getLastAttempted() : null;
        });
    }
}
```

#### Username Configuration

Inside of our `config/fortify.php` file, we must change the `username` option to `username` from `email`:

```php
// config/fortify.php

// Before:
'username' => 'email',

// After:
'username' => 'username',
```

You will notice above that we are passing in an array of credentials with
`samaccountname` as the key, and the requests `username` form input.

### Database Migration

The built in `users` database table migration must also be modified to use a `username` column instead of `email`:

```php
// database/migrations/2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table.php

// Before:
$table->string('email')->unique();

// After:
$table->string('username')->unique();
```

### Sync Attributes

When using usernames, we must also adjust the `sync_attributes` option inside
of our `config/auth.php` file. We will adjust it to reflect our `username`
database column to be synchronized with the `samaccountname` attribute:

```php
// config/auth.php

'providers' => [
    // ...

    'ldap' => [
        // ...
        'database' => [
            // ...
            'sync_attributes' => [
                'name' => 'cn',
                'username' => 'samaccountname',
            ],
        ],
    ],
],
```

> Remember to add any additional database columns you need synchronized here.

### Login View

Now we must open up the `login.blade.php` view and swap the current HTML input field from `email`
to `username` so we can retrieve it properly in our `Fortify::authenticateUsing()` callback:

```html
<!-- Before: -->
<div>
  <x-jet-label value="Email" />
  <x-jet-input
    class="block w-full mt-1"
    type="email"
    name="email"
    :value="old('email')"
    required
    autofocus
  />
</div>

<!-- After: -->
<div>
  <x-jet-label value="Username" />
  <x-jet-input
    class="block w-full mt-1"
    type="text"
    name="username"
    :value="old('username')"
    required
    autofocus
  />
</div>
```

### User Model

If you plan on allowing non-LDAP users to register and login to your application,
you must adjust the `$fillable` attributes property on your `app/Models/User.php`
to include the `username` column instead of `email`:

```php
// app/Models/User.php

class User extends Authenticatable implements LdapAuthenticatable
{
    // ...

    // Before:
    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'email',
        'password',
    ];

    // After:
    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'username',
        'password',
    ];
}
```

## Fallback Authentication

Database fallback allows the authentication of local database users if **LDAP
connectivity is not present**, or **an LDAP user cannot be found**.

To enable this feature, you must define a `fallback` array inside of the credentials
you insert into the `Auth::validate()` method in your `Fortify::authenticateUsing()` callback:

```php
// app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php

use Laravel\Fortify\Fortify;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    // ...

    public function boot()
    {
        $this->registerPolicies();

        Fortify::authenticateUsing(function ($request) {
            $validated = Auth::validate([
                'mail' => $request->email,
                'password' => $request->password,
                'fallback' => [
                    'email' => $request->email,
                    'password' => $request->password,
                ],
            ]);

            return $validated ? Auth::getLastAttempted() : null;
        });
    }
}
```

For example, given the following `users` database table:

| id  | name         | email               | password | guid   | domain |
| --- | ------------ | ------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1   | Steve Bauman | sbauman@outlook.com | ...      | `null` | `null` |

If a user attempts to login with the above email address and this user does
not exist inside of your LDAP directory, then standard Eloquent authentication
will be performed instead.

This feature is ideal for environments where:

- LDAP server connectivity may be intermittent
- Or; You have regular users registering normally in your application

> If you would like your LDAP users to be able to sign in to your application
> when LDAP connectivity fails or is not present, you must enable the
> [sync passwords](#database-password-sync) option, so your LDAP
> users can sign in using their last successfully used password.
> <br/><br/>
> If an LDAP users password has not been synchronized, they will not be able to sign in.

## Eloquent Model Binding

If you are using [database synchronization](/docs/laravel/v1/auth#database), model binding allows
you to access the **currently authenticated user's** LdapRecord model from their Eloquent
model. This grants you access to their LDAP data whenever you need it.

To begin, insert the `LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\HasLdapUser` trait onto your User model:

```php
// app/Models/User.php

// ...
use LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\HasLdapUser;
use LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\LdapAuthenticatable;
use LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\AuthenticatesWithLdap;

class User extends Authenticatable implements LdapAuthenticatable
{
    //...

    use HasLdapUser;

    // ...
}
```

Now, after an LDAP user logs into your application, their LdapRecord model will be
available on their Eloquent model via the `ldap` property:

> If their LDAP model cannot be located, the returned value will be `null`.

```php
// Instance of App\User
$user = Auth::user();

// Instance of App\Ldap\User
$user->ldap;

// Get LDAP user attributes
echo $user->ldap->getFirstAttribute('cn');

// Get LDAP user relationships:
$groups = $user->ldap->groups()->get();
```

> This property uses deferred loading -- which means that the users LDAP model only
> gets requested from your server when you attempt to access it. This prevents
> loading the model unnecessarily when it is not needed in your application.

## Displaying LDAP Error Messages

When using Laravel Jetstream, LDAP error messages will now be displayed automatically
to users. You do not need to configure or include the `ListensForLdapBindFailure`
trait as you would using [Laravel UI](/docs/laravel/v1/auth/laravel-ui/#displaying-ldap-error-messages)
on the `LoginController`.

### Altering the Response

Since this functionality is now automatically registered, if you would like to modify how
an error is handled, call the `setErrorHandler` method on the `BindFailureListener`
class inside of your `AuthServiceProvider.php` file:

```php
// app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php

// ...
use LdapRecord\Laravel\Auth\BindFailureListener;

class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    // ...

    public function boot()
    {
        $this->registerPolicies();

        BindFailureListener::setErrorHandler(function ($message, $code = null) {
            if ($code == '773') {
                // The users password has expired. Redirect them.
                abort(redirect('/password-reset'));
            }
        });
    }
}
```

> Refer to the [Password Policy Errors](/docs/laravel/v1/active-directory/users/#password-policy-errors)
> documentation to see what each code means.

### Changing the Error Messages

If you need to modify the translations of these error messages, create a new translation
file named `errors.php` in your `resources` directory at the following path:

> The `vendor` directory (and each sub-directory) will have to be created manually.

Then, paste in the following translations in the file and modify where necessary:

```php
<?php

return [
    'user_not_found' => 'User not found.',
    'user_not_permitted_at_this_time' => 'Not permitted to logon at this time.',
    'user_not_permitted_to_login' => 'Not permitted to logon at this workstation.',
    'password_expired' => 'Your password has expired.',
    'account_disabled' => 'Your account is disabled.',
    'account_expired' => 'Your account has expired.',
    'user_must_reset_password' => 'You must reset your password before logging in.',
    'user_account_locked' => 'Your account is locked.',
];
```
