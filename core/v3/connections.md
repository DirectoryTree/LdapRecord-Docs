# Connections

## Introduction

Once you've defined your [configuration](/docs/core/v3/configuration), you
must then create a connection and insert your configuration into it:

```php
use LdapRecord\Connection;

$connection = new Connection([
     'hosts'    => ['192.168.1.1'],
     'username' => 'cn=user,dc=local,dc=com',
     'password' => 'secret',
]);
```

## Connecting

Once you have your connection, call `connect()` to bind to your LDAP server:

```php
try {
    $connection->connect();

    echo "Successfully connected!";
} catch (\LdapRecord\Auth\BindException $e) {
    $error = $e->getDetailedError();

    echo $error->getErrorCode();
    echo $error->getErrorMessage();
    echo $error->getDiagnosticMessage();
}
```

### Connecting Anonymously

If you'd like to connect/bind anonymously to your LDAP
server, simply set your `username` and `password`
configuration parameters to `null`:

```php
use LdapRecord\Connection;

$connection = new Connection([
     'hosts'    => ['192.168.1.1'],
     'username' => null,
     'password' => null,
]);

$connection->connect();
```

## Binding

Using the connection instance, you can execute a bind request
to perform LDAP authentication to see if a username and
password is valid.

```php
$user = 'cn=user,dc=local,dc=com';
$password = 'secret';

if ($connection->auth()->attempt($user, $password))
{
    echo "Username and password are correct!";
}
```

> **Important**: After calling the above, the user you have configured
> in your connection configuration will be **rebound** to your
> LDAP server. This is to ensure you can continue
> to execute LDAP operations underneath a working
> user during the same request.

If you would like to run all further LDAP operations underneath the
authenticated user **for the duration of the request**, pass in
`true` in the third parameter in the `attempt()` method:

```php
$user = 'cn=user,dc=local,dc=com';
$password = 'secret';

if ($connection->auth()->attempt($user, $password, $stayBound = true))
{
    echo "Username and password are correct!";

    // Run further LDAP operations under this user.
}
```

> **Important**: Binding as the user will not persist LDAP connectivity between requests.
> PHP is stateless - which means a new LDAP connection is created upon every request
> to your application. LdapRecord **does not and will not store** user credentials
> to persist connectivity.

## Container

You must add your LDAP connections into the container if you would
like to use LdapRecord models. Models pull the connection that
they use from this container by their name.

### Adding Connections

```php
use LdapRecord\Container;
use LdapRecord\Connection;

$connection = new Connection(['...']);

$connection->connect();

Container::addConnection($connection);
```

> If you do not call `connect` on your connection prior to adding
> it into the `Container`, it will be connected to automatically
> when you attempt to retrieve query results.

Each connection you add can have it's own name. This is
required for connecting to multiple LDAP servers at
one time. To set the name of a connection in the
container, pass it into the second parameter:

```php
Container::addConnection($connection, 'domain-b');
```

Without passing in a name, the name of the connection is
set to `default`. Passing in multiple connections
without providing a name will overwrite the
previously added connection, so be sure to
identify them differently if needed:

```php
use LdapRecord\Container;
use LdapRecord\Connection;

$connectionAlpha = new Connection(['...']);
$connectionBravo = new Connection(['...']);

Container::addConnection($connectionAlpha);

// This will overwrite $connectionAlpha:
Container::addConnection($connectionBravo);
```

If you do not define a `$connection` property inside of your
LdapRecord models, they will use your default connection.

### Getting Connections

To get the default connection, call the `getDefaultConnection` method:

```php
$connection = Container::getDefaultConnection();
```

To get a differently named connection, call the `getConnection` method:

```php
$connection = Container::getConnection('domain-b');
```

### Setting Default Connection

To set the name of the default connection, call the
`setDefaultConnection` method prior to adding a connection:

```php
Container::setDefaultConnection('domain-a');

Container::addConnection(new Connection(['...']));

// Returns the `domain-a` connection.
$connection = Container::getDefaultConnection();
```

### Checking Connection Existence

To check if a connection exists, call the `hasConnection()` method:

```php
if (Container::hasConnection('domain-b')) {
    // The 'domain-b' connection exists!
}
```
