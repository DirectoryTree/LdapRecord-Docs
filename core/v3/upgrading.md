title: Upgrade to LdapRecord v3
description: Upgrading from LdapRecord v2

# Upgrading to Version 3

We strive to record all potential breaking changes. However, as some of
these changes occur in lesser-known areas of the library, only a 
fraction of them might have an impact on your application.

If you encounter any changes not documented here that have affected you, 
please create a bug report on the [LdapRecord-Docs repository](https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord-Docs/issues/new) 
so that we can address the issue promptly.

## High Impact Changes

### Updating Dependencies

#### PHP >= 8.1.0 Required

LdapRecord v3 now requires PHP 8.1.0 or greater.

#### Composer Dependencies

You should update the following dependency in your application's `composer.json` file:

```json
"directorytree/ldaprecord": "^3.0"
```

#### `iconv` PHP Extension Required

The `iconv` extension is now required, as it is used for encoding passwords 
using the default mechanism when setting Active Directory user passwords.

It has always been used in LdapRecord, however an exception would 
have been thrown previosuly upon executing code utilizing it.

### Strict PHP Types Implemented

LdapRecord now has strict types implemented in all classes for all methods and properties.

If you've created your own [models](/docs/core/v3/models), [scopes](/docs/core/v3/model-scopes), 
or have extended any other LdapRecord class, you will need to adjust any overridden 
properties or methods with their respective types.

## Medium Impact Changes

### LdapRecord\Container `manager` Method Renamed

An `LdapRecord\Container::manager()` method has been renamed to `getConnectionManager()`.

### LdapRecord\ConnectionManager Proxy Methods Removed

The below `LdapRecord\ConnectionManager` proxy methods have been removed. 

You may replace these methods with their listed equivalent:

| Proxy Method Removed   | Replacement         |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| `reset()`              | `flush()`           |
| `allConnections()`     | `getConnnections()` |
| `getEventDispatcher()` | `getDispatcher()`   |
| `setEventDispatcher()` | `setDispatcher()`   |

### LdapRecord\ConnectionManager Methods Renamed

The below `LdapRecord\ConnectionManager` methods have been renamed:

| Old Method               | New Method               |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `add()`                  | `addConnection()`        |
| `remove()`               | `removeConnection()`     |
| `all()`                  | `getConnections()`       |
| `get()`                  | `getConnection()`        |
| `getDefault()`           | `getDefaultConnection()` |
| `setDefault()`           | `setDefaultConnection()` |
| `dispatcher()`           | `getDispatcher()`        |
| `setDispatcher()`        | `setDispatcher()`        |
| `unsetEventDispatcher()` | `unsetDispatcher()`      |

### LdapRecord\Utilities Removed

The `LdapRecord\Utilities` class has been removed in favor of
individual utility classes that provide the same features and functions.

Please see the [helpers](/docs/core/v3/helpers) documentation for their equivalent utility classes.

### Tightenco/Collect Replaced

The `tightenco/collect` package has now been replaced with Laravel's core 
`illuminate/collections` package, that became available in Laravel 8.0.

Due to this change, if you're installing LdapRecord in a Laravel 
application, it must be at least version 8.0.0 or greater.

### LdapRecord\Query\Builder methods renamed

The below query builder methods have been renamed to more 
clearly convey the LDAP action that they will execute:

| From                | To                   |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| `listing()`         | `list()`             |
| `createAttribute()` | `addAttribute()`     |
| `updateAttribute()` | `replaceAttribute()` |
| `deleteAttribute()` | `removeAttributes()` |
| `N/A`               | `removeAttribute()`  |

## Low Impact Changes

### LdapRecord\Ldap Method Return Types Changed

#### `bind`

The `Ldap::bind()` method now returns an `LdapRecord\LdapResultResponse`, 
which provides a class for interacting with an LDAP response in detail:

```php
$connection = new \Ldap\Connection(['...']);

$response = $connection->getLdapConnection()->bind($username, $password);

$response->errorCode; // int
$response->matchedDn; // string|null
$response->errorMessage; // string|null
$response->referrals; // array|null
$response->controls; // array|null

$response->successful(); // bool
$response->failed(); // bool
```

#### `parseResult`

The `Ldap::parseResult()` method now returns an `LdapRecord\LdapResultResponse`, 
as with the `bind()` method mentioned above.

### LdapRecord\Models\Relations\OneToMany Method Return Types Changed

The methods listed have had their return type changed:

| Method     | New Return Type |
|------------|-----------------|
| `attach()` | `void`          |
| `detach()` | `void`          |

```php
$groups = ['...'];

$user = User::find('...');

// Returns "void"
$user->groups()->attach($groups);
```

### LdapRecord\Models\Relations\OneToMany Methods Removed

The methods listed below have been removed:

| Method         |
|----------------|
| `attachMany()` |
| `detachMany()` |

You may now simply provide a variable that is `iterable` (such as an `array` 
or `Collection`), to attach or detach many models for a relationship.

### LdapRecord\Models\Relations\HasOne Method Return Type Changed

The `HasOne::attach()` method now no longer returns a value (`void`). I.e.:

```php
$manager = User::find('...');

$user = User::find('...');

// Returns "void"
$user->manager()->attach($manager);
```

### LdapRecord\Models\OpenLDAP\User & Group Relations Adjusted

The built-in OpenLDAP `User` and `Group` model relationships (`Group::members()` 
and `User::groups()`) have been adjusted with their proper configuration, 
and now have full integration tests on the repository.
